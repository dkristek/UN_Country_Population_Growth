# Country_Population_Growth

## Selected Topic: Forecasting Population Growth in the United Nations' four largest countries (by population) (United States, China, Indonesia, and India)

## Reason why we selected this topic: 
There are varying opinions of whether the population of the world is sustainable from a resources perspective. Population has a unique impact the sustainability of our climate, education system, and economy. We seek to understand the population growth trends within the United Nationsâ€™ four largest countries (in terms of population): United States, China, Indonesia, and India. We will then use this data to make inferences about population viability.

## Description of Source Data: 
Our primary source of data is United Nations census data for the United States, China, Indonesia, and India. This includes total population statistics and growth percentages. (https://population.un.org/wup/DataQuery/)

## Questions we hope to answer with the data:
- Is the population in the United Nations' largest countries (in terms of population) growing or declining?
- Are we at a point where we should seek to accelerate or decline population expansion?
- Are certain countries more likely to have stronger population growth than others?
- What will the population of these countries look like in the next 5 years?

## Description of communication protocols
- Our team is mainly communicating via a Slack channel - during class sessions, we divide work and confirm each member's deliverables on this slack channel. We also discuss any barriers that need to be handled as a team
- We also have our Google slides to draft presentation ideas
(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lzzH5QWJL6UF9R3eWyLcfaqSGRQeHIwNNbpT4gfCJ90/edit#slide=id.g13be2890723_0_6)
- Finally, we all have each other's emails to connect if there are any Slack issues

## Provisional Database
Our team has created a provisional SQL database using PGAdmin.
There are two main tables
- Countries: Each country name with a unique identifier

- Populations: UN population data

## Provisional Machine Learning Model
Our team created a provision ML model to analyze the time-series data. An ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) was used to analyze the data and forecast population values.

The model can be seen below

The forecasted population values and test values can be seen below

## Provisional Dashboard 
The dashboard is set to display initial analysis elements, accuracy graph from machine learning model, projected graph displaying results predicted by ML model, and interactive element displaying the growth of population recorded from 1990 to 2021. 

The visual elements to be displayed along with the technology are listed in detail below: 
 1. Global heatmap displaying countries by population.
  - Technology: GeoJSON, Tableau, PANDAS
 2. Horizontal bar chart interactively displaying populations of countries by selected year
  - Technology: Plotly, Tableau, HTML, Javascript
 3. Line graph depicting the predictive rate of machine learning model compared to actual testing data
  - Technology: Statsmodels library, MATPLOTLIB, Tableau
 4. Bar chart or line graph that displays the projected populations, predicted by ML model over the next 5 years
  - Technology: MATPLOTLIB, PANDAS, Tableau, Plotly
