# State_Population_Growth

## Selected Topic: Forecasting Population Growth in the United Nations' four largest countries (by population) (United States, China, Indonesia, and India)

## Reason why we selected this topic: 
There are varying opinions of whether the population of the world is sustainable from a resources perspective. Population has a unique impact the sustainability of our climate, education system, and economy. We seek to understand the population growth trends within the United Nations’ four largest countries (in terms of population): United States, China, Indonesia, and India. We will then use this data to make inferences about population viability.

## Description of Source Data: 
Our primary source of data is United Nations census data for the United States, China, Indonesia, and India. This includes total population statistics and growth percentages. (https://population.un.org/wup/DataQuery/)

## Questions we hope to answer with the data:
- Is the population in the United Nations' largest countries (in terms of population) growing or declining?
- Are we at a point where we should seek to accelerate or decline population expansion?
- Are certain countries more likely to have stronger population growth than others?
- What will the population of these countries look like in the next 5 years?

## Description of communication protocols
-Our team is mainly communicating via a Slack channel - during class sessions, we divide work and confirm each member's deliverables on this slack channel. We also discuss any barriers that need to be handled as a team
-We also have our Google slides to draft presentation ideas
(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lzzH5QWJL6UF9R3eWyLcfaqSGRQeHIwNNbpT4gfCJ90/edit#slide=id.g13be2890723_0_6)
-Finally, we all have each other's emails to connect if there are any Slack issues

##Provisional Database
Our team has created a provisional SQL database using PGAdmin.
There are two main tables
- Countries: Each country name with a unique identifier
